# Data: Current Population Survey

`dataCPS` is an R package that pulls CPS public microdata from the census bureau website on install and packs it into an 
## Installation R package.

To install  the package, execute:

```r
devtools::install_github("DanielBonnery/dataCPS")
```
Note that installation is slow, because part of the installation process is the downloading of data from the Census Bureau website.
